              This was my first project from General Assembly's Web Development
              Immersive Course. It was an individual project built in a week,
              and was both the first proper game I had built, and my first
              real-world type practice with JavaScript.

            <span>Rating Ninja is a web application that uses MongoDB, Express and
              Node.js to store a collection of user added data such as Restaurants.
              It utilises user authentication to register and log in a user to allow
              them to make changes to their own data and to add reviews to all restaurants.

            <span>
              Rating Ninja was my second project from General Assembly's Web Development
              Immersive. It was an individual project built in one week, and was
              my first multi-page, web app that didn't only involve working with
              the front-end. Working on this project helped me understand the
              basics of working with databases using Node.js packages and the MVC model.</span>
